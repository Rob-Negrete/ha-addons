# Issue-Driven Development Workflow

<!-- This template ensures every issue follows our complete 8-step development workflow -->

## 🎯 Step 1: Problem & Solution Definition

### Problem Statement

**What is the issue or opportunity?**

<!-- Clear description of the problem, bug, or feature need -->

**Impact on users:**

<!-- How does this affect the user experience or system functionality? -->

**Type of Change:**

- [ ] 🚀 **New Feature** - Adding new functionality
- [ ] 🐛 **Bug Fix** - Fixing existing functionality
- [ ] 📚 **Documentation** - Updating docs, guides, or comments
- [ ] 🔧 **Technical Debt** - Refactoring, optimization, or maintenance
- [ ] 🏗️ **Infrastructure** - CI/CD, deployment, or tooling changes

### Current vs Expected Behavior

**Current State ❌:**

<!-- How does the system currently behave? -->

**Expected State ✅:**

<!-- What should the system do instead? -->

### Proposed Solution

**High-level approach:**

<!-- Your proposed solution or fix -->

**Technical components involved:**

<!-- List the main technical areas this will touch -->

**Alternative approaches considered:**

<!-- Any other solutions you evaluated -->

## 🔧 Step 2: Technical Implementation Plan

### Architecture & Design

**System components affected:**

<!-- Which parts of the system will change? -->

**API changes:**

<!-- Any new or modified endpoints, functions, or interfaces -->

**Database/Storage changes:**

<!-- Any schema, data structure, or storage modifications -->

**UI/Frontend changes:**

<!-- Any user interface or user experience changes -->
