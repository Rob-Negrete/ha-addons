# Coverage Baseline Configuration
# This file centralizes all coverage thresholds and baselines used across the project.
# Update these values in ONE place to change coverage requirements project-wide.

# Primary baseline coverage percentage (used by CI/CD and all coverage tools)
baseline_coverage: 90.0

# Status thresholds (derived from baseline)
thresholds:
  # Green: Coverage at or above baseline (PASS)
  green_min: 90.0 # baseline_coverage

  # Amber: Coverage slightly below baseline (WARNING)
  amber_min: 80.0 # baseline_coverage - 10.0
  amber_max: 89.9 # baseline_coverage - 0.1

  # Red: Coverage significantly below amber threshold (FAIL)
  red_max: 79.9 # amber_min - 0.1

# File-level priority thresholds (for identifying improvement targets)
file_priorities:
  # Files with coverage below this are HIGH priority
  high_priority_max: 70.0

  # Files with coverage below this are MEDIUM priority
  medium_priority_max: 90.0 # baseline_coverage

  # Files above medium_priority_max are LOW priority

# Smart target selection thresholds
target_selection:
  # Maximum coverage percentage for a function to be considered a valid improvement target
  max_coverage_threshold: 90.0 # baseline_coverage

  # Minimum number of lines for a function to be considered worth improving
  min_lines: 5

# Display settings
display:
  # Decimal places for coverage percentages in reports
  decimal_places: 2

  # Emojis for status indicators
  status_emojis:
    green: "ðŸŸ¢"
    amber: "ðŸŸ¡"
    red: "ðŸ”´"
